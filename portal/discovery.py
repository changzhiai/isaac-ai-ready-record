"""
ISAAC Discovery — hypothesis-driven reasoning workbench (data-access layer).

ISOLATION CONTRACT (read before editing):
- Every function here talks ONLY to the isolated isaac_discovery database via
  database.get_discovery_db_connection(). It must NEVER call
  database.get_db_connection() (the privileged records connection). The single
  exception is read-only provenance lookups, which use
  database.get_readonly_db_connection() (records, READ ONLY) to resolve a record
  title for display — see resolve_record_summaries().
- Hypotheses/projects/predictions are NOT ISAAC records and never enter the
  records table or the frozen standard. They live only in isaac_discovery.
- discovery_user is least-privilege and physically cannot reach the records DB,
  so this contract is also enforced at the credential level; the rule above
  keeps the application code honest on top of that.

Table DDL lives in database.init_discovery_tables() (Dean's marker), created on
startup. This module is the CRUD + activity-feed + provenance surface that the
Discovery page and the /portal/api/* discovery endpoints call.
