"""
ISAAC Discovery — hypothesis-driven reasoning workbench (data-access layer).

ISOLATION CONTRACT (read before editing):
- Every function here talks ONLY to the isolated isaac_discovery database via
  database.get_discovery_db_connection(). It must NEVER call
  database.get_db_connection() (the privileged records connection). The single
  exception is read-only provenance lookups, which use
  database.get_readonly_db_connection() (records, READ ONLY) to resolve a record
  title for display — see resolve_record_summaries().
- Hypotheses/projects/predictions are NOT ISAAC records and never enter the
  records table or the frozen standard. They live only in isaac_discovery.
- discovery_user is least-privilege and physically cannot reach the records DB,
  so this contract is also enforced at the credential level; the rule above
  keeps the application code honest on top of that.

Table DDL lives in database.init_discovery_tables() (Dean's marker), created on
startup. This module is the CRUD + activity-feed + provenance surface that the
Discovery page and the /portal/api/* discovery endpoints call.

      • contradicts → −strength × 1.25         (falsification is more decisive)
      • a STRONG contradiction of a falsifier ~ falsified (confidence capped ≤0.15)
      • neutral     → a SMALL negative (a test that ran and found NO predicted effect
                      is mild evidence against — distinct from 'no test')
      • insufficient→ 0 (not enough data — no shift, but it IS a test that didn't resolve)
      • blocked     → 0 and EXCLUDED from belief (SCHEMA GATE: the comparison is
                      methodologically incompatible / ill-posed — not a measurement, so
                      it can't move belief; it only lowers COVERAGE)
    EVIDENCE INDEPENDENCE (use-novelty) is enforced in the math, gated by grounding:
      • a 'supports' with fitted-parameter overlap (evidence_independence) on an
        AD-HOC hypothesis is ACCOMMODATION — it contributes 0 and is not decisive
        (circular_discounted). On a STANDING-PRIOR (literature) hypothesis the same
        overlap is a consistency check — kept but capped at weak (circular_softened),
        never zeroed. Inspiration (a trend that merely motivated the hypothesis) is
        NOT discounted at all.
      • CORRELATED same-direction verdicts (sharing the same evidence — a record ID OR
        the same underlying CALCULATION, by mlflow_run_url / slurm_job_id) are attenuated
        to {_atten}× and don't add to n_decisive — you can't confirm twice with the same
        data OR the same calc, nor fake reliability by stacking predictions on one result.
        This holds whether a calc is cited as a compute_run on one prediction and re-used
        (after being persisted as a record) on a sibling: the SAME calculation counts ONCE.
        It is dedup, NOT a down-weight — an agent-computed value and an archived one carry
        equal weight; only self-corroboration on one hypothesis is removed.
      • ROBUSTNESS vs INDEPENDENCE (optional per-verdict `observable_key`): two same-direction
        decisive verdicts that test the SAME observable (same quantity@system) via DIFFERENT
        evidence — e.g. the same ΔΔE recomputed PBE then RPBE — are ROBUSTNESS, not two
        independent verdicts. The 2nd is attenuated to {_robust}× (more than re-citing the same
        number, because cross-method agreement is informative, but less than a fresh test) and
        does NOT add to n_decisive. So varying the FUNCTIONAL on one observable can harden
        belief but CANNOT by itself make a one-observable hypothesis 'reliable' — only a
        DIFFERENT discriminating observable can. Opt-in: omit observable_key and independence
        is judged on evidence identity alone (as before).
      • CITED-TO-DATA: a decisive verdict that links NEITHER a record (evidence_record_ids)
        NOR a compute_run still moves belief but does NOT count toward n_decisive and never
        trips the falsification cap. You cannot be 'reliable' — or refute — on evidence you
        never linked. This makes citing structural, not optional (mirrors cross_system /
        low-reliability: belief, not standing).
      • ADMISSIBLE-TO-COUNT: a decisive verdict counts toward n_decisive (and can hard-falsify)
        ONLY if it is a complete, auditable test — CITED (record/compute_run), FALSIFIABLE
        (its prediction states a falsification_criterion), STRUCTURED (direction + reference_
        condition; magnitude stays an advisory nudge), and EXPLAINED (carries a rationale).
        Any verdict failing a facet still moves belief but earns no standing (belief, not
        standing — like cross_system). So 'reliable' = >=2 such complete, independent decisive
        verdicts — a hypothesis earns standing only on a SET of genuinely auditable tests, never
        on uncited, unfalsifiable, under-structured, or unexplained claims. The breakdown tracks
        each facet (uncited/unfalsifiable/unstructured/unexplained_excluded).
    SHARPNESS (optional per-verdict `margin` ∈ [0,1]): how decisively the observation
    diverged past the falsification threshold. Scales the contribution 0.7×..1.3×
    within the strength tier, and a STRONG contradiction only triggers the falsification
    cap when its breach is decisive (margin None or ≥0.5) — a barely-past-threshold
    strong contradiction is strong evidence-against, not an automatic kill.
    CROSS-SYSTEM (optional per-verdict `cross_system`=true): evidence borrowed from a
    DIFFERENT material / reaction / mechanism class (an analog). It can SUGGEST but never
    ESTABLISH — capped at weak, contributes a little, but does NOT count toward n_decisive
    and never trips the falsification cap. A hypothesis cannot become 'reliable' on
    borrowed analogs alone (the Cu-Ag lesson). The rigor critic audits transferability.
    RELIABILITY (optional per-verdict, server-derived `reliability_tier`): how much to
    TRUST the datum — established/corroborated/single_source/contested/anecdotal. It
    multiplies the contribution, and contested/anecdotal (weak-provenance) move belief but
    do NOT count toward n_decisive. OPT-IN: an undeclared verdict (tier None) scores
    exactly as before. The tier is SERVER-derived from a machine-checkable basis (the
    agent can't self-assert 'corroborated' — reproduced_by must cite INDEPENDENT records).
    confidence = sigmoid(Σ). strength ∈ {{strong:1.0, moderate:0.6, weak:0.3}}; an
    omitted/unknown strength is treated as WEAK (the conservative tier). A score from
