"""
Trace provenance primitives — WHO reasoned, and WHY.

PURE LOGIC (no DB, no Flask) so the whole contract is unit-testable offline, matching
the pattern of `record_provenance` (content hashing) and `record_authz` (edit rights).

Two objects travel with a discovery event:

  * `actor_model` — WHICH model produced this step. A multi-account, multi-vendor
    reproducibility study is uninterpretable without it, and a fine-tuning corpus built
    from unattributed traces is worthless. HONESTY IS THE POINT: the portal can verify
    the *principal* (server-stamped from the Bearer token) but it cannot verify which
    model a client claims to be running. So model identity is stamped
    `identity_trust='client_attested'` and must never be presented as verified.

  * `decision` — WHY. Not just the state change: what was CHOSEN, what was REJECTED and
    on what grounds, and what the step is BLOCKED on. A trace that records only what
    happened cannot teach anything; the rejected branch is often the informative one.

Both are optional at the API boundary and normalized here. Anything unrecognised is
dropped rather than stored, so a malformed client cannot poison the ledger.
