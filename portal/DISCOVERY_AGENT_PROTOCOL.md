# ISAAC Discovery — Agent Operating Protocol (v0.1, provisional)

> How an agent operates on an ISAAC **scientific-discovery project**. This is the
> *reasoning* layer — separate from, and not part of, the frozen ISAAC **records**
> standard (`schema/`, the records wiki). Hypotheses/projects are NOT records.
>
> The machine-readable version of everything below is served live at
> **`GET /portal/api/discovery/manifest`** (public, no auth) — an agent's first
> call. This document is the human-readable companion.
>
> **Status:** provisional. The state machines and compute loop reflect a first
> model; they are being reconciled with the practitioners who have run this loop
> in production. Expect v1 to adjust the lifecycles and field shapes.

## Prime directive (the kernel)

1. **Read before you act.** At the start of every turn on a project, call
   `GET /portal/api/projects/{id}/briefing`. It is the **authoritative current
   state** — a curated digest, not the full firehose. Reconcile your working
   memory to it; the dashboard wins any conflict.
2. **Write after you act.** Every hypothesis, prediction, verdict, status change,
   and compute run is an API write. **If it is not on the dashboard, it did not
   happen.** Never hold important project state only in your own context.
3. **One project = one ground truth.** Do not fork reality in your head.

These are affordances, not just etiquette: the briefing *hands* you the truth, the
API *rejects* malformed writes, and the manifest *is fetched* rather than
remembered — so doing the right thing is the easy thing.

## Connect

- Base URL: `https://isaac.slac.stanford.edu/portal/api`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (PI's token from the portal **API Keys**
  page; the user must be in an allowed group). Identity is server-stamped — you
  cannot spoof `owner_identity`.
- Bootstrap: `GET /portal/api/discovery/manifest` (no auth).

## Object model

`project → hypotheses → predictions`; an append-only `events` journal; one
`next_experiment` per project. `evidence_record_ids` are plain ISAAC record IDs in
the records DB — referenced read-only, never written from here.

## State machines

- **Hypothesis `status`:** `proposed → supported | eliminated | needs_more_data | superseded`
  (set via `PUT /hypotheses/{id}` with `confidence` 0–1 and `confidence_basis`).
- **Prediction `work_status`** (drives the Validation board):
  `awaiting_evidence → more_work_pending → compute_submitted → compute_running → evaluated`.
- **Prediction `verdict`** (the scientific outcome, set at `evaluated`):
  `supports | contradicts | neutral | insufficient`, with `strength` `strong|moderate|weak`.

`work_status` and `verdict` are **orthogonal**: one says where in the pipeline a
prediction is, the other says what it concluded.

## Per-turn loop

```
GET /projects/{id}/briefing            # ground yourself
… reason …
POST /projects/{id}/hypotheses         # a new idea
POST /hypotheses/{id}/predictions      # a testable consequence
PUT  /predictions/{id}/evaluate        # got data → verdict + evidence_record_ids + mlflow_run_url
PUT  /hypotheses/{id}                   # ranking changed → status/confidence
PUT  /projects/{id}/next_experiment    # the discriminating next step
POST /projects/{id}/events             # one line per reasoning step (transcript)
```

## Compute loop (calculations as the reasoning happens)

```
submit NERSC/DFT/MLIP/microkinetics job
PUT /predictions/{id}/status {work_status: "compute_submitted", mlflow_run_url}
PUT /predictions/{id}/status {work_status: "compute_running"}      # when it starts
PUT /predictions/{id}/evaluate {verdict, strength, evidence_record_ids, mlflow_run_url}
```

The dashboard renders `compute_submitted` / `compute_running` predictions as
"what we're waiting on," and the Compute ledger aggregates the MLflow runs.

## Field shapes to standardize

- **`origin`** (how a hypothesis was formed):
  `{type: agent_reasoning|literature|prior_result|human, summary, reasoning, sources:[{record_id|doi|hypothesis}]}`.
- **MLflow runs** — post as a structured `event`
  (`{event_type: compute_running, detail: "<run_name> / <what_it_computed> / <status>", mlflow_run_url}`),
  not a bare URL, so the Compute ledger has substance.
- Use the event-type, `work_status`, `status`, and `verdict` vocabularies above
  verbatim.

## The invariant

**If it is not on the dashboard, it did not happen.** The dashboard is the shared
brain for the project; your context is scratch space.

## v0.2 additions (hardened from the first real Cu-Au cycle)

These come from one fully-executed discrimination cycle (real VASP on Perlmutter,
UMA benchmark, CatMAP, MLflow). They are now in the contract; the briefing-5 below
is the next increment.

**Hypotheses are a graph, not a list.** Relate them with
`POST /hypotheses/{id}/relations {to_hypothesis_id, relation_type, note}`,
`relation_type ∈ {supersedes, derived_from, competes_with, co_operating}`.
`derived_from` carries an analogy transfer (Cu-Au → Cu-Ag); `co_operating` says two
mechanisms can both be partly true (not everything competes).

**Predictions discriminate.** A good prediction differs in what each hypothesis
predicts for it. Declare that with `discriminates: [{hypothesis_label, expected}]`
when you create the prediction; the server aggregates these into the
cross-hypothesis **discrimination matrix** that drives next-experiment selection.

**Compute is multi-run with a real lifecycle.** A prediction has MANY runs (a
failed job + its resubmit both belong to one prediction). Register each:
`POST /predictions/{id}/runs {backend, engine, resource, slurm_job_id,
mlflow_run_url, status, params, metrics}` and advance it with `PUT /runs/{run_id}`.
`status ∈ {queued, running, completed, failed, resubmitted}`. Backends are **data**
(`vasp`, `uma`, `catmap`, …), not a fixed enum — any engine plugs in. Design for
minutes-to-hours latency.

**Methodological compatibility is a non-negotiable gate.** Before an evidence
record can support/contradict a prediction, its method must match: same
`output_quantity` (ΔE vs ΔG), functional, and corrections (PBE vs UMA-RPBE are NOT
comparable). State the prediction's `output_quantity`; the dashboard resolves each
evidence record's method from the records DB and flags incompatible comparisons. A
verdict resting on a mismatch is surfaced as a warning, not trusted silently.

**Verdicts are atomic; the confidence rollup is a separate, swappable step.** Write
each verdict via `/evaluate`. Updating a hypothesis's confidence/status from its
verdicts is a distinct, auditable reasoning step (heuristic net-score now; Bayesian
posterior is roadmap). Don't fold them together.

**The briefing-5 (the next increment).** The ground-truth digest will always show,
at the top: (1) goal; (2) ranking + confidence; (3) an **evidence index keyed by
descriptor** — what already exists for this system (so you never say "no data" when
it's there); (4) a **methodological-compatibility ledger**; (5) the
**pending-experiment queue** ranked by discriminating power vs cost.

## v0.4 fixes (from the first end-to-end agent run)

- **Endpoint base path is explicit.** All endpoint paths are relative to
  `base_path` = `https://isaac.slac.stanford.edu/portal/api` — e.g.
  `base_path + "/projects"`. Do **not** prepend `/discovery/`; the manifest merely
  lives under `/discovery/`. (The manifest now carries `base_path` + a note.)
- **Vocabulary is accept-and-normalized.** Verdicts and relation types map common
  synonyms to canonical on write — `refutes → contradicts`, `inconclusive →
  neutral`, `co_operates_with → co_operating`, etc. Prefer the canonical terms,
  but natural words won't silently break the briefing's categorization anymore.
- **`POST /events` requires `summary`** (one line); `detail` is optional/long.
- **`next_experiment` is REPLACE, not merge**, and now preserves **all** keys you
  send (no silent drop). Send the complete object each PUT.
- **Evidence `system_role` is classified by the composition element-set + formula,
  not the material name** — so "Interdigitated Au–Cu …" is no longer misread (the
  free-text name was extracting Indium from "Interdigitated").
