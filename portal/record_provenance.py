"""
Record provenance primitives — content hashing + material/cosmetic classification.

PURE LOGIC (no DB, no Flask) so it can be unit-tested offline and reused by both the
records store (versioning) and the discovery side (drift detection). The contract:

  * content_hash(record) is STABLE: the same scientific content always hashes the same,
    INCLUDING after a round-trip through PostgreSQL JSONB (which reorders keys and
    coerces numbers). This is what makes drift detection trustworthy — a cosmetic
    re-save must not change the hash; a real change always must.
  * The hash is computed over a WHITELIST of scientific blocks only. Volatile metadata
    (attribution/ownership, timestamps, record_id, routing, tags, schema version) is
    EXCLUDED — so an owner-reassign or a tag edit is "cosmetic" by construction and can
    never spuriously trigger downstream re-examination.

Reviewed (3 adversarial sub-agents, 2026-06-30): whitelist-not-blacklist; hash the
JSONB-stored form; NFC unicode; preserve nulls (null != missing) and list order; no
float rounding; hash asset CHECKSUMS not URIs.
