"""Verify the actor_model threading deploy: the gap becomes visible, and NOTHING moves.

The change lets an agent's attestation reach hypothesis / prediction / verdict /
next_experiment events instead of being overwritten by the portal's signature. It is
additive, so the bar is high in a specific way:

  1. the new compliance key is present and populated
  2. the misattribution it reports is REAL (cross-checked against the raw ledger)
  3. every computed confidence is byte-identical to the pre-deploy baseline

(3) is the one that matters. Confidence is computed from verdicts and is the single number
the whole discovery engine turns on; an "additive" change that perturbs it has broken the
science while looking clean. Baseline first, compare after.

  # BEFORE the deploy
  python3 verify_deploy_attribution.py --baseline --out baseline.json
  # AFTER
  python3 verify_deploy_attribution.py --check baseline.json [--write-probe PROJECT_ID]

--write-probe is the only end-to-end proof that the fix works: it creates a hypothesis WITH
an actor_model and asserts the event kept the agent's signature rather than the portal's.
It writes to the named project, so point it at a scratch project, never a real one.
