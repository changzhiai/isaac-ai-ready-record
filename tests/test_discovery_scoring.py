"""
Canonical discovery-scoring unit tests.

`compute_hypothesis_score` is THE single way a hypothesis earns confidence in the
Discovery workbench: confidence is COMPUTED from the prediction verdicts (never
authored). It runs only against a live DB at runtime, so before these tests it had
zero offline coverage — a refactor could silently break the scoring math and the
record-validation battery would never notice. This pins the verdict→log-odds→sigmoid
contract, the schema gate (blocked), the reliability threshold, and the strong-
contradiction cap as pure functions (no DB, no API).

Keep this in lockstep with the manifest's `scoring_model` (discovery.get_manifest):
if a weight or rule changes, the manifest prose and these assertions move together.
